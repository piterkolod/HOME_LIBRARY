This is my first unassisted project in Django, created after Python bootcamp at Coderslab in Warsaw.

On the homepage, there are two sections - a "recommended book" on the left (in fact, it's a random object drawn every time you refresh the page) and the list of books on the right (sorted by last added object).
Full list of books is sorted by title, you can go for details by clicking in selected position.
Logged user can add new books, edit and delete existing one.
